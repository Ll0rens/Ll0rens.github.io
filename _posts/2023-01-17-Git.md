## General Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among multiple people, and it allows users to keep track of different versions of files, revert back to previous versions, and merge changes from different sources. Git is widely used by software developers and is considered a standard tool in the software development industry.


## Merge vs Rebase

`git merge` and `git rebase` are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another, but they do so in different ways.

`git merge` creates a new merge commit in the target branch that brings in all the changes from the source branch. This results in a linear history with multiple branches merging into the main branch. It is a simple way of integrating changes and useful when you want to preserve the entire branch history.

`git rebase` replays the commits from the source branch on top of the target branch, creating new commits in the process. This results in a linear history, with the commits from the source branch appearing as if they were made at a later point in time. It's a good option when you want to keep the branch history clean and avoid unnecessary merge commits.

It's important to note that `git rebase` can have some drawbacks like rewriting the commit history, it can cause conflicts and can lead to loss of commits, so it's better to use it with caution when working in a team.

In summary, git merge is useful when you want to preserve the entire branch history, while git rebase is useful when you want to keep the branch history clean and avoid unnecessary merge commits.

## Types of Merge

There are several types of merge in Git, each with its own set of benefits and use cases:

    - `Fast-forward merge`: This type of merge is used when the current branch is a direct ancestor of the branch being merged. The current branch's pointer is simply moved forward to point to the same commit as the branch being merged. This type of merge does not create a new commit and results in a linear history.

    - `Recursive merge`: This is the default merge strategy in Git. It creates a new merge commit that brings in all the changes from the branch being merged. It is useful when you want to preserve the entire branch history.

    - `Octopus merge`: This type of merge is used when merging multiple branches at once. It creates a new merge commit for each branch being merged and results in a complex history.

    - `Squash merge`: This type of merge is used when you want to combine multiple commits from a branch into a single commit. It is useful when you want to keep the branch history clean and avoid unnecessary merge commits.

    - `Three-way merge`: This type of merge uses a common ancestor to resolve any conflicts that may arise when merging branches. It is useful when you have multiple branches with independent changes and want to bring those changes together.

It's important to note that the type of merge you choose will depend on your project's requirements and workflow, and it's important to communicate with other team members when you're planning to use one of these types of merge.

## Rewriting history

Rewriting history in Git refers to changing the commit history of a branch. This can include things like amending or reordering commits, squashing multiple commits into one, or even removing commits entirely.

There are several Git commands that allow you to rewrite history, such as `git commit --amend`, `git rebase -i`, `git filter-branch`, and `git push -f`.

It's important to note that rewriting history can have consequences, particularly when working in a collaborative environment. When rewriting history, the new commits will have different SHA-1 hashes than the original commits, making it difficult to track which commits were changed and when. It can also cause conflicts if other team members have already pulled the original commits and made changes based on them.

For this reason, it's generally considered best practice to avoid rewriting history on branches that have been shared with others or on branches that are part of a public repository. Rewriting history should only be done on branches that are local or on branches that are only shared with a small number of trusted team members.

In summary, rewriting history in git refers to the process of changing the commit history on a branch. It can have consequences, particularly when working in a collaborative environment, and it should be done with caution.

## Git squash

git `git squash` is a way to combine multiple commits into a single commit in Git. This is useful when you want to keep the branch history clean and avoid having multiple commits that represent small, incremental changes. It's also useful when you want to simplify the history before merging it into another branch.

For example, let's say you're working on a feature branch and you've made several commits that include small changes, bug fixes, and intermediate commits, you can use git squash to condense all those commits into a single commit that represents the final version of your work.

Here's an example of how you might use git squash:

``
\# Start an interactive rebase
$ git rebase -i HEAD~4

\# This will open a text editor with the last 4 commits listed.
\# Change the first word of each commit to "squash"
\# except the one you want to keep as it is

\# Save and close the editor

\# This will squash the last 3 commits into the first commit

\# You can edit the commit message as well if you want

\# Finally, use `git push --force` to update the remote branch with the new history.

``
